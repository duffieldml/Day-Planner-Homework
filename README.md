# day-planner

Are you sick of not knowing how your day will plan out? Cuz I am.

Thank god we have this sweet day planner to help with such struggles.

This planner allows you to enter items in for an hour time block. The time block will change color to indicate whether the item is in the past, present, or future. 

The day planner uses mostly javascript for laying out logic to create the planner, check the current time, and save the entered data to the local storage.
